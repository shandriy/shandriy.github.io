<hr>
<p>This was my second main layout, and it was incredibly strange.</p>
<p>It was based on hash-based navigation, and this meant that all the page content was stored as small snippets of HTML, inserted dynamically into the page.</p>
<p>This required updating a script on the index page, which I kept forgetting to do.</p>
<p>In terms of the design, the colors changed a bit, but overall it's mostly the same as the previous layout.</p>
<p>The other pages on this layout should still work, though.</p>
