## 16/12/2024 - Night Time Exploration and Where I've Been

Yes, I'm still alive. It's been a while since my last post on this website - actually, it's been a while since my last update on this website at *all*. I don't have much to talk about, so this post will just be an update on what I've been doing recently and my plans for this website in the future. It's a bit of a short post, but a necessary update. TL;DR: Yes, I will keep working on this website; I'm just busy.

### Where I've Been

The past few weeks a lot has been happening in school. Mostly, I've been preparing for finals (or just sitting and worrying about how I'll fail instead), which are this week. I haven't had much time to focus on the website, and the free time I did have I spent playing Minecraft. Most classes have been giving much more homework recently, and I haven't done much interesting things other than that. It's been really hard to find motivation to do anything that requires a larger amount of thinking, although maybe that's just because I'm not sleeping enough.

The biggest things I've done this past while is fix my grades; I don't have anything below a B now, and play Minecraft, like I mentioned, although that's only been the past two or three days. So far the Minecraft world is going pretty well. I got 11 diamonds, and made an automatic bamboo farm. My friend (thank you Zeva!) built a ton of stuff, like this storage room and a fountain. Unlike me, she actually has building skills so my world doesn't look like shit for once, and if anything, looks really pretty!

### Music

On a completely unrelated note, I find it so interesting how my music taste changes. I finally ended up putting together a playlist on Spotify, instead of using my liked songs list. It's a bit out of order right now, but once I fix it I'll probably link it somewhere on this website. Also, you should try listening to [Нева](https://youtu.be/pltTzVz8mEA?feature=shared) by 5'nizza. Yes, my music taste is really bad but this one's actually good.

### Night Time Exploration

Ok, I lied earlier when I said I didn't do anything interesting recently. Yesterday, I went out at night (yes, this is interesting - I don't go outside or touch grass unless I'm forced to. Shut up). It was surprisingly fun, even though it was freezing. My original plan was to climb the supports of this bridge on a railroad track nearby to where I live. I ended up not doing it (there was a no trespassing sign and I'm a coward), but I did take some pretty cool photos, I think.

<div style="text-align:center">
<p style="text-indent:0">
<img src="/static/img/There_is_Help.jpg" style="width:40%;display:inline">
<img src="/static/img/Gate.jpg" style="width:40%;display:inline">
</p>
</div>

Probably the biggest reason this was so fun was because of the risk - I could've been caught exiting the house any time by my parents, but surprisingly I didn't. I'm probably gonna repeat this again some time. Exploring new places in general also seems very fun, but especially abandoned areas - knowing that something is manmade, but no humans are there is terrifying.

### The Future of This Site

Ok, now about this website: what am I planning to do now? Mostly, I want to figure out a way to continuously make blog posts without running out of ideas. I'm not really sure how I would do this, so other than that here are my plans:

* Add a mini-blog section; I want to be able to provide smaller updates without having to write whole posts, like this.
* Make a separate page for my webring.
* Rework the site design; yes, I changed it fairly recently but there are still a lot of things I don't like. If I can get it to look good, I'll make the site green (hi again Zeva).
* Rework the site layout; right now, the layout isn't very accessible. Lots of images don't have labels or alternative text, and I used `div`s for everything instead of specialized elements like `content`.
* Rework the build script - Ok, this is a lot of reworking. This is my last priority, because the build script is fine as it is; I still want to make it better, though.

### Next Time

I'll try my best to make another blog post before the end of the month; worst case, my next post will be on New Year's day (I promise!) Thank you for reading! See you next time!
