This my website I made to rant about whatever I want regardless of how obscure or uninteresting it is. I speak English and Russian.

I like programming and especially focusing on backwards-compatible JS. Planning to learn C or C++ next. My favorite video games are Hollow Knight, osu, SOUND VOLTEX, and Project Sekai. I'm interested in trying KanColle, Touhou and Bravely Default more.

I really like music! (However that doesn't stop me from having shit music taste) Some of my favorite songs:

- Pacific Girls - DJ Sharpnel
- end of a life - Mori Calliope
- Over The Fullereneshift - DJ Sharpnel
- wanting, getting, wanting - DEMONDICE
- Любовь моя - Элла на маковам поле
- IJIMEKKO Bully - Mori Calliope
- Hazy Skyscraper - DEMONDICE
- Sealed Vessel - Christopher Larkin
- ИСКАЛА - Zemfira
- die alone - Jvne
- Daisy 2.0 - Ashnikko
- Glitter - lexycat
- Дорадура - Дора
- Cold Green Eyes - Station Earth
- cutlery - uki3
- it WAS yo mf birthday but im late - schnozz
- it's always a good time - schnozz
- Oshama Scramble! - t+pazolite
- Pain - PinkPantheress
- Running Up That Hill - Kate Bush
- Graveyard Shift - Mori Calliope

This list isn't exactly in order and probably missing a lot. I'll continue updating it.

I have a tendency to restart unfinished projects a lot so if this website looks terrible - it's partially because I want it to look simple and be lightweight, without having to load fonts and as cross-platform as possible. It's also just because I tried to get it up as fast as possible without worrying about styling. I'll do that later. For now I'll just try to get some content on this.

~~So far there are no other pages. I had a few blog posts on my old website but I don't like them anymore so I won't be transfering them here.~~ Check out my blog [here](/notes/index.htm)! I might also add an archive of my old website eventually.

## Projects

- Nerdle - [Play it here](https://shandriy.github.io/nerd) - [Source code](https://github.com/shandriy/nerd) (Yes it's terrible but that was a while ago. I promise I can do better now and also I was rushing to finish it in like a day)
- SVG Country Flags - [WIP](https://github.com/shandriy/flags) - I've mostly given up at this point but hopefully I'll add more someday.
- There are more but I privated the GitHub repos (I don't remember why) so I'll add them later.

## Other

Links to some random pages I like:

- [microsounds](https://microsounds.github.io/) - Inspired me to keep working on my website!
- [eden's website](https://eda.gay) - Currently the design is basically just taken straight from there. (This isn't true anymore, but still a really cool page!)
- [nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) - Where I used to host my site!
- [neocities](https://neocities.org) - Similar to nekoweb. I haven't really used it but still pretty cool.

## Goals

At the moment, my goals for this site (and in general) are:

- ~~Make a better SSG.~~ Done! The new SSG is written in POSIX Shell and basically gets variables from a custom script and substitutes them into the templates.
- ~~Add a few more pages.~~ [Here](/notes/2024/11/17.htm) and [here](/notes/2024/11/23.htm).
- Learn C or C++. Maybe C# (Yes I'm not stupid I know that C# and C/C++ are very different it's just that I want to learn C/C++ because of the wide support and how it's lower level. C# is a lot higher level which means less control (tragic) but it's also easier and it seems to be the only language who's users don't hate it)
- 3d web-based rendering engine with Chrome 1 support - This means no WebGL, but it should be possible. Performance is the main problem, along with how only affine transformations can be performed on Canvas2d. There are ways to hide this as much as possible though.
