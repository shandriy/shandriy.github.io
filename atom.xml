   gacha - gachas are basically just gambling, which is what makes it
   addictive, but the gacha in KanColle is more than that. Instead of

   use and how many. And your shipgirls aren't permanent - if one of them
   dies, you lose her forever. This means the gacha rewards are more
   expendable resources, and discourages too much grinding for a specific
