    <summary>   The past few weeks a lot has been happening in school. Mostly, I've
   been preparing for finals (or just sitting and worrying about how I'll

   the website, and the free time I did have I spent playing Minecraft.
   Most classes have been giving much more homework recently, and I
   haven't done much interesting things other than that. It's been really
   hard to find motivation to do anything that requires a larger amount of
